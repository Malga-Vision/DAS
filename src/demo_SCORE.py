# Keep trehshold very low, such that it looks like zero. And select K according to how much you

# The key point is: I know exactly how much I am going to wait, because for d nodes and K param, I have 
# d*K edges to check with CAM, that's it.
# This way the threshold loses its improtance, K is a much more meaningful parameter + it is already in CAM
# and finally, the trick I use retains it value, become the crucial point. 
# Could I do same with pns setting it to 5? Yes, but it is way slower

# plus, i have apriori control on running time
# If CAM runs with O(.) complexity, than I can get an expected running time.
